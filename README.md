# Lab 1: Language Identifer based on Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
In this project , we implement a Language Identifer (LID) by using two Methods:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic regression

For the Naive Bayes, we got the score of 91.5%.

For the Logistic regression, we got the score of 93.3%

# Lab 2: Introduction to Words representation
